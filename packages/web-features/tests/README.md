# Baseline Tools Test Suite

Simple test suite to validate the enhanced baseline tools functionality.

```

## What We're Testing

### Enhanced Features Being Validated:

1. **Dynamic Pattern Generation** - Does your `generateDetectorsFromBaseline()` create better patterns?
2. **Rich Output Formatting** - Does the output include icons, summaries, and better formatting?
3. **Smart Alternatives** - Does `set-my-browse` suggest better baseline features?
4. **Enhanced Detection** - Does the detection find more features than basic patterns?

### Expected Features in Modern App:

- **CSS**: Grid layout, `:has()` selector, container queries
- **JavaScript**: AbortController, navigator.clipboard, fetch API, async/await
- **TypeScript/React**: Modern React patterns, TypeScript features

## Running Tests

```bash
# Navigate to the web-features package directory
cd web-features-HACKED-sg/packages/web-features

# Run the test suite
node tests/test-runner.js
```

## Expected Results

- ✅ All three tools should run without errors
- ✅ Enhanced detection should find modern features
- ✅ Output should include rich formatting (emojis, icons, summaries)
- ✅ Tools should provide helpful error messages and suggestions

## Test Output

The test runner will:
1. Execute each tool with sample code
2. Check for expected feature detection
3. Validate enhancement features are present
4. Generate a summary report
5. Save detailed results to `test-results.json`

## Success Criteria

- **Detection Rate**: Should detect most expected features
- **Enhancement Features**: Should show rich formatting and better UX
- **Error Handling**: Should handle test cases gracefully
- **Output Quality**: Should be more informative than basic tools
